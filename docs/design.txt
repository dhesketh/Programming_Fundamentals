A program is required that prompts a user for their current mood, and what they would like their mood to be. It then recommends a song for them and displays a link for them to click to listen to that song. The program will then as them if they would like to run the program again, or if they feel the way they want to feel.

  desiredMood
  randomArrayChoice

3. Solution Algorithm

DesiredMoodSongGenerator
  Initialize and prompt for currentMood with "How are you feeling? happy, sad, angry, tired, excited"
  Initialize and prompt for desiredMood with "How do you want to feel? happy, sad, angry, tired, excited"
  Initialize suggestedSong
  Initialize randomArrayChoice

  Have arrays for each mood type with titles and links to songs
    Use function to generate random number to pull from proper array
    function randomArrayChoice
    return moodArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * moodArray.length)

  Case with if statement
    if currentMood === desiredMood
      display "You don't need this program"
    else
      case happy
	suggestedSong = randomArrayChoice(happySongs)
      case sad
	suggestedSong = randomArrayChoice(sadSongs)
      case angry
	suggestedSong = randomArrayChoice(angrySongs)
      case tired
	suggestedSong = randomArrayChoice(tiredSongs)
      case excited
	suggestedSong = randomArrayChoice(excitedSongs)
      case default
	display "Are you sure you entered the correct values? Click to try again"

  display "Here is a song to make you " + desiredMood + suggestedSong
  display "If that didn't help, click here to try again"
